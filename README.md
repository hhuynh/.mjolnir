When switching between external monitor and laptop screen, the window positions change depending on the size of the screen.
It's very annoying these positions don't get restored when you go between screens. So this script help you store the current positions and restore them afterward.

Save:    CMD + Option + S
Restore: CMD + Option + R

Unfortunately you have to save/restore manually. My goal is to be able to do this automatically.
